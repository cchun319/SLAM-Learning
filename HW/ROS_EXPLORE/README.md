# TURTLEBOT_EXPLORATION

## INTRODUCTION
The project was deployed in ROS.
To perfrom the automatic exploration tasks, the particle filter was used to construct the map, and Dijkstra/path pruning method was used to calculate the distance of all grids to the robot's current position, and finally, the information gain algo. determined where to go to give the robot best utility(information - cost)
